CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:50 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "fbjni" with any of
  the following names:

    fbjniConfig.cmake
    fbjni-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "fbjni" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "fbjni_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "fbjni"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
